# Quantum Information Bootcamp: Logic Gates and IBM Quantum Composer Task üß†üîå

## Introduction üåå

Logic gates stand as the bedrock of digital circuits, wielding pivotal influence in both classical and quantum computing. These gates empower us to manipulate binary inputs (0s and 1s) to yield specific outputs, paving the way for intricate computations and decision-making.

In this enthralling mission, your voyage entails harnessing the prowess of IBM Quantum Composer. Your task? Construct AND, NAND, OR, and XOR gates, verifying the accuracy of their truth tables and submitting your accomplishments.

## Task üìù

1. **AND Gate:**
   - Utilize IBM Quantum Composer to craft a circuit orchestrating an AND gate. This gate bestows an output of 1 exclusively when both inputs are 1; otherwise, it yields 0.
   - Validate that the truth table of your AND gate circuit aligns with the following:

   | Input A | Input B | Output |
   |:-------:|:-------:|:------:|
   |    0    |    0    |    0   |
   |    0    |    1    |    0   |
   |    1    |    0    |    0   |
   |    1    |    1    |    1   |

   - Capture a panoramic screenshot of your meticulously architected AND gate circuit in IBM Quantum Composer, unveiling the intricate tapestry of gate configurations and connections.

2. **NAND Gate:**
   - Forge a circuit for the revered NAND gate, summoning IBM Quantum Composer's prowess. This gate conjures 0 only when both inputs materialize as 1; otherwise, it conjures 1.
   - Ascertain that the truth table of your NAND gate circuit mirrors the following:

   | Input A | Input B | Output |
   |:-------:|:-------:|:------:|
   |    0    |    0    |    1   |
   |    0    |    1    |    1   |
   |    1    |    0    |    1   |
   |    1    |    1    |    0   |

   - Freeze the ethereal moment in a screenshot, encapsulating your masterful NAND gate circuit in IBM Quantum Composer.

3. **OR Gate:**
   - Summon an OR gate circuit into existence, harnessing IBM Quantum Composer's prowess. This gate weaves a narrative where 0 emerges solely from dual 0 inputs; contrarily, it bequeaths 1.
   - Guarantee that the truth table of your OR gate circuit resonates with the following:

   | Input A | Input B | Output |
   |:-------:|:-------:|:------:|
   |    0    |    0    |    0   |
   |    0    |    1    |    1   |
   |    1    |    0    |    1   |
   |    1    |    1    |    1   |

   - Capture the enigmatic aura of your OR gate circuit in IBM Quantum Composer through an artful screenshot.

4. **XOR Gate:**
   - Conjure the enchantment of an XOR gate circuit using IBM Quantum Composer's spell. This gate entwines its fate with 0 when both inputs resonate alike (either in 0-ness or 1-ness); in all other instances, it conjures 1.
   - Embark on a truth table verification expedition, ensuring that the contours of your XOR gate circuit harmonize with the following:

   | Input A | Input B | Output |
   |:-------:|:-------:|:------:|
   |    0    |    0    |    0   |
   |    0    |    1    |    1   |
   |    1    |    0    |    1   |
   |    1    |    1    |    0   |

   - Seal this tale of computational wonder with a captivating screenshot, one that unveils the symphony of your XOR gate circuit in IBM Quantum Composer.
